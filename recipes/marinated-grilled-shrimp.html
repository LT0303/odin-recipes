        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Learn how to marinate shrimp for grilling with 
            this easy marinade that makes your shrimp so 
            yummy you don't even need cocktail sauce. Don't 
            let the cayenne pepper scare you — you don't 
            even taste it. My young kids love it. It is also 
            a big hit with company and easy to prepare. I 
            make this with frozen or fresh shrimp and use 
            y indoor electric grill if the weather is not 
            good for outdoor grilling. Try it with a salad, 
            baked potato, and garlic bread.</p>

            <li>6 each skewers</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

                garlic, and red wine vinegar in a large bowl. 
                Season with basil, salt, and cayenne pepper. 
                Add shrimp to the bowl; stir until evenly 
                coated. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes 
                to 1 hour, stirring once or twice.</li>

            <li>Thread shrimp onto skewers, piercing once near
