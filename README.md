This project involves creating a basic recipe website using the HTML skills I've learned from The Odin Project so far.

Over the course of this project, I practiced creating the 
basic HTML boilerplate, using elements such as a, img, ol/
ul, etc. to construct and format a homepage and 
three recipe pages. I also practiced using the terminal and 
CLI to make directories, move and rename files and directories,
and create new .html files.

I also created an external stylesheet and added declarations for color, alignment (text and images), height, width, and font to be applied to different elements using type and class selectors.
